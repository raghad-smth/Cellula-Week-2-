🖼️📝 Text & Image Classifier

📍 Introduction

This project is a simple sentiment analysis app that combines an image (or image caption) with additional user text to predict whether the final combined text is positive or negative, along with a confidence score.
	•	Option 1: Upload an image → the app will generate a caption using a multimodal model.
	•	Option 2: Enter an image caption manually.
	•	In both cases, you then provide an additional text input.
	•	The system combines both inputs, runs them through a sentiment classifier, and produces a result with a confidence score.

The goal of this project is mainly educational:
	•	To practice working with different models (image-to-text + text classification).
	•	To experiment with deployment using Streamlit.

📍 System Architecture

The system is composed of three main parts:

1️⃣ Input Handling (image_caption.py)
	•	Users can upload an image or enter a caption manually.
	•	If an image is uploaded, we use BLIP (Bootstrapping Language-Image Pre-training), a multimodal model that converts images into text.
	•	We used BLIP v1 (lighter & faster than BLIP v2).
	•	Chosen because it can be downloaded and run locally (since Hugging Face does not offer a free API for BLIP).
	•	If a caption is entered manually, we skip this step and use the provided text directly.

2️⃣ Classification (classifier.py)
	•	The caption (generated or manual) is combined with the additional user text.
	•	This combined input is sent to a sentiment analysis model:
	•	cardiffnlp/twitter-roberta-base-sentiment-latest
	•	A variant of RoBERTa pre-trained specifically for sentiment classification.
	•	The output is a label (positive, negative, neutral) and a confidence score.
	•	The model is accessed via the Hugging Face Inference API, so no heavy local downloads are needed.

3️⃣ Data Storage (records.csv)
	•	Every classification result is stored in a CSV file for tracking.
	•	Each row contains:
	•	image_caption
	•	user_text
	•	combined_input
	•	label
	•	score

📍 User Interface (Streamlit)

The entire app is wrapped in a Streamlit UI for easy interaction:
	•	Upload images / enter captions.
	•	Enter additional text.
	•	View generated captions, sentiment predictions, and scores.
	•	See past records stored in CSV.

Streamlit also provides a shareable local network link so others can test it while your computer is running.

📍 Lessons Learned
	1.	✅ Always check model availability on Hugging Face:
	•	Some models are available via API.
	•	Some must be downloaded locally.
	•	This influences design decisions.
	2.	✅ First time working with Streamlit — found it extremely simple and effective for deployment.
	3.	✅ Importance of hiding warnings:
	•	Keep them visible during debugging.
	•	Hide them during deployment for cleaner user experience.
	4.	✅ Learned about BLIP (Bootstrapping Language-Image Pre-training):
	•	Converts images → text.
	•	Has many real-world applications (accessibility, content generation, etc.).
	5.	✅ Realized that building real systems often requires multiple models, not just one.
	•	Here, we used BLIP (image → text) + RoBERTa (text sentiment classification).
	6.	✅ Sentiment models are often dominated by strong words.
	•	Example: “beautiful sunrise” + “death” → likely classified as negative because of word weighting.
	7.	✅ Coding today is less about writing everything from scratch.
	•	It’s about knowing how to use, adapt, and connect tools/models effectively.
